### My Goal In This Project

First of all, I worked for a dynamic website. I used web components and SPA architecture for this.
I used PUB/SUB and Store structure for data sharing and automatic rendering of some components. He helped with some components of the project. Each component is designed not to affect each other.
Local storage was used as the database. Interactive data from the user is recorded here and used to create dynamic content.
A control panel was created for user logins. New users and new content can be added here.

Dark/Light mode and language options have also been added to the site. Thus, the user will be able to choose according to his preference.

Efforts were made to ensure that every designed component and page was responsive.

I was wondering about SPA with Vanilla JS. I found an opportunity for this in this study. This was a different experience for me too.
I thank you https://www.hackyourfuture.net/ for this.
